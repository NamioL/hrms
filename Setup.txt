node seeder/user-seeder.js

npm run start


1) We can set Manager to Employee 
   we can set manager to any employees, in user table I add new field manager where I am passing user_id

   if you go http://localhost:3000/admin/leave-applications 
   then choose a user you can see Calender with a leave, I did not delete old part of the view too.

3) HR should have a ablibity to mark attandence for any employee:
   HR(admin) user has a ability to mark any employees attandence on the current day
